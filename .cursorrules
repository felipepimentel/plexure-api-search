# Plexure API Search - Cursor Rules

# Code Preservation Rules
- Never remove existing code that is not directly related to the current change scope
- Always maintain existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change
- Keep all existing imports and dependencies unless they are specifically being refactored
- Preserve existing error handling and logging mechanisms
- Maintain existing configuration options and defaults
- Keep all existing CLI commands and their functionality
- Do not remove or modify existing tests unless they are directly related to changes
- Preserve existing documentation unless it needs to be updated for new changes
